Requirements
-------------

Python 2.3 or later.

Installation
-------------

As with other Python packages, the standard way of installing from source
is (as root or administrator)::

    python setup.py install

Running Tests
--------------

The tests can be run with the built in unittest module, however, it is
much easier to run with the nose package.  With that installed, you can
use either of the following::

    python setup.py test
    nosetests

Building Documentation
----------------------

The documentation is written in restructured text using the sphinx module.
Building it is as simple as::

    python setup build_sphinx

The API documents can be generated using one of four programs:

* epydoc
* pydoc
* pydoctor
* doxygen

To bulid these, simply run the following command and the available
packages will sipmly be built::

    python setup build_api
